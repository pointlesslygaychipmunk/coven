# Tarot Ritual Integration

## Work Completed

1. **Created TarotRitual Component**  
   Created a comprehensive React component for performing tarot card rituals with:
   - Card placement in a ritual circle
   - Cosmic influences based on moon phase and season
   - Ritual power calculations
   - Success chance and potency modifiers
   - Visual effects for ritual casting
   - 90s-inspired UI elements

2. **Created TarotRitual.css**  
   Comprehensive styling with:
   - Ritual circle layout
   - Card position styling
   - Element-based colors
   - Animation effects
   - Responsive design elements

3. **Added performTarotRitual Handler in SimpleApp.tsx**  
   Implemented the ritual handler function that:
   - Updates player mana
   - Tracks used cards
   - Awards appropriate skill experience
   - Updates game state with ritual results
   - Provides success/failure feedback

4. **Updated Imports in SimpleApp.tsx**  
   - Added import for TarotRitual component

## Remaining Changes

Due to challenges with viewing the complete SimpleApp.tsx file because of its size, the following changes still need to be implemented:

1. **Add Menu Item for Rituals**  
   Look for the navigation menu in SimpleApp.tsx that contains menu items for 'garden', 'brewing', etc. and add:
   ```jsx
   <div className="menu-item" onClick={() => setView('rituals')}>Rituals</div>
   ```

2. **Add Conditional Rendering for TarotRitual**  
   Find the section in SimpleApp.tsx that conditionally renders different views based on the 'view' state and add:
   ```jsx
   {view === 'rituals' && (
     <TarotRitual
       playerInventory={gameState.players[gameState.currentPlayerIndex].inventory}
       playerMana={gameState.players[gameState.currentPlayerIndex].mana}
       playerSkills={gameState.players[gameState.currentPlayerIndex].skills}
       currentMoonPhase={gameState.time.phaseName}
       currentSeason={gameState.time.season}
       onPerformRitual={performTarotRitual}
     />
   )}
   ```

## Testing the Integration

After making these changes, you can test the integration by:

1. Running the application
2. Clicking on the new "Rituals" menu item
3. Selecting a ritual
4. Placing tarot cards in the appropriate positions
5. Performing the ritual to see the effects

The ritual system replaces the previous spell system, providing a more strategic and thematic gameplay experience that aligns with the Hanbang-inspired direction of New Coven.
